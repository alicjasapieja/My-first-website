        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>My name is Damla. I am a teacher studying Software Engineering and Psychology. Needless to say, my free time is limited but there are still ways that I love to spend it. Read on to get to know me a little better.</p>

        <h2 id="My Educational Journey">My Educational Journey</h2>
        <p>I started off completing my Bachelor of Education (P-12) majoring in English and Student Welfare. After working in the industry for 5 years, I started to realise that I just don't see myself working in a school setting for the rest of my life. I thought, 'why not pursue something that I have always loved?' and so, I delved into the Graduate Diploma of Psychology. As the road to becoming a Clinical Psychologist is a long one, I need a change of career in the near future. And here we are, studying Software Engineering. So far, I really am enjoying it.</p>       
        <h2 id="Free Time">Free Time</h2>
        <p>Although my free time is limited these days, there are a few things that I still love to do. The main one is going out for dinners around Melbourne. I love to explore new restaurants and try different cuisines. I also love to stay active and am currently frequenting reformer pilates. I also like to travel whenever I can.</p>
